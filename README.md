## Polkadot Conformance Tests

This repository is in the process of being developed, with the goal of defining strategies to ensure that the current implementations of Polkadot nodes adhere to the blockchain specification. The scripts within rely on specific endpoints, designated for conformance tests, to send encoding requests, retrieve node data, and perform various other tasks.

The repository contains Python scripts designed to interact with a Polkadot node. By sending encoding requests and comparing the results, these scripts help verify that the node operates according to the specified guidelines. Additionally, there are plans to include other scripts to evaluate different aspects of the nodes, such as state management, node host API, and more.
